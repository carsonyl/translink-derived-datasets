TransLink derived datasets
==========================

These are transit-related GeoJSON datasets for Metro Vancouver,
derived from the [TransLink Open API](https://developer.translink.ca/) and
[GTFS Static Transit datasets](https://developer.translink.ca/ServicesGtfs/GtfsData).

These are the derived datasets:

* `stops/all_stops.geojson`:
  All Metro Vancouver transit stops, in one GeoJSON file.
* `route-patterns`:
  All bus route patterns, as defined by the TransLink Open API.
  Each pattern is a GeoJSON file.
* `shapes`:
  All GTFS trip shapes.
  Each shape is a GeoJSON file.

These datasets are current as of **2018-05-06**.

As GeoJSON, these files can be previewed from within GitHub.
